* More coming soon!

> **NOTE**: Almost all of my 3,500 GitHub contributions over the past four years are for various CI/CD, DevOps, IaC, Docker, Kubernetes, custom Jenkins pipeline scripting, and other such projects associated with an employer, and thus are proprietary and not publicly available.
>
> As a result, I am legally unable to share these projects and associated work. I am going to be focused on more open source projects in the future, so stay tuned!
